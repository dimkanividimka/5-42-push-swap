# 5-42-push-swap
Program to sort stack of numbers in ascending order with help of one extra stack

# Push-swap Project
The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project: data must be sorted.
A set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks are available.
The goal is to write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.

# How to use
- clone
- make
- run with bash: ./push_swap *your numbers separated by space*
- if the sequence is already sorted in ascending order - it won't return anything!
